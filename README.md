# inefficient-pathfinding
An inefficient but nonetheless working pathfinding algorithm. 

`solveMaze(maze, START, END, WALL, SPACE)` 
- `maze` is a 2D array of characters representing a maze, with characters `WALL` as a blocked square and `SPACE` as a walkable square. 
- Returns the solution path of `maze` from the location of `START` to the location of `END` as a list of coordinate 2-tuples.
